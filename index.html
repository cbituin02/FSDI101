            <h4>My THoughts on HTML 101:</h4>
            <p>I am enjoying this class very much and it makes it better that the other classmates here make you feel welcomed. Since this is an accelartaed program it does feel very stressful at times. My worse fear is forgetting everything that I have learned so far, however the instructor explains the material very well and the tutor is also very helpful in times of need. The classmates help each other out as well and it makes learning a lot easier. I can say for myself that learning web development is very interesting and it is cool to learn and understand what goes behind the process of making a fully functional website.</p>
