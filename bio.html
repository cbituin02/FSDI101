        <h3>Bio</h3>

            <p class="container">Hello! My name is Caleb and I am 19 years old. I graduated high school in the year of 2020. So this is my 2nd year going into college. I took this class because I wasn't sure what career I wanted to pursue. However I can say that I enjoy learning to code. I am the youngest of my family of 5. My dad is a retired Navy and my oldest brother is in the active reserves. I have moved around probably 6 to 7 times in my lifetime. I grew up playing video games and I still do enjoy playing games but I do like going out as well. I love finding new foods and new places to eat. I like going to small kick backs with my close friends as well and I always looks forward to spending time with my family, cousins and nephews.</p>

        <h3>Aspirations</h3>

            <p class="container">I hope that I can turn what I in this program into a career that I am happy with. And that what I keep learning over the years of my life. I want to be able to live a comfortable and happy life that isn't completely took over by work.</p>
